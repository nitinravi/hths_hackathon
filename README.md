# Musicia
A python script which converts your voice input to musical notes and plots the graph to display it!
Yep that's pretty much it.

## How to run
- Run the pip install command on `requirements.txt` file to make sure all libraries required for the program are installed
- First run the app.py file along with the input like `python app.py -input 2`
- Now the app should be up and running ready to detect your amazing voice's musical note ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62639059/118400761-a1b51380-b680-11eb-93d8-5b1b00cfaf25.png)
- Once this is done your notes are saved in the `output.txt` file, so just go ahead and run the `plot.py` for your musical notes in a graphical representation fit to play on an instrument! ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62639059/118400828-f6588e80-b680-11eb-9244-5180e75b5e53.png)
- Alternatively you could also run the program.py file for a pygame representation with a live feed of what note the device detects.

## Tools used for developement

- VScode as an IDE
- PyCharm as an IDE
- Kali Linux (cuz windows sucks)
